# MANDATORY: DOC-BOT INTEGRATION RULE
# Add this to your agent configuration (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, copilot-instructions.md, etc.)

## DOC-BOT PRIORITY PROTOCOL

**DETECTION**: If this project has `doc-bot/` folder OR doc-bot MCP server available:

**MANDATORY ACTIONS**:
1. Code generation keywords (write, create, implement, build, add, code, function, class, component, method, develop, generate, make) → Call `check_project_rules` FIRST
2. Project questions (how, what, why, architecture, approach, pattern, feature + "this project"/"this codebase"/"here"/"our") → Call `search_documentation` FIRST  
3. Documentation queries (documentation, available, capabilities, help, rules, standards) → Call `get_global_rules` FIRST
4. File-specific work (file, directory, working on, specific, [filename], path) → Call `get_relevant_docs` FIRST

**ENFORCEMENT**:
- NEVER generate code without checking project rules
- NEVER answer project questions from general knowledge alone
- Project documentation overrides standard practices
- Use doc-bot tools BEFORE providing any project-related response

**FAILURE RECOVERY**: If you catch yourself answering without doc-bot tools, STOP, call appropriate tool, re-answer based on tool response.

Test: Ask "What documentation is available?" - agent should call get_global_rules immediately.
