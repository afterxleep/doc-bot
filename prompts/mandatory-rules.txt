## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

2. **Compliance Check**: Verify each rule before code generation
3. **Conflict Resolution**: When conflicts arise, project rules take precedence
4. **Validation**: Ensure all generated code follows these patterns

## ENFORCEMENT POLICY:

- **Non-negotiable**: These rules cannot be bypassed or modified
- **Refusal Protocol**: If user requests conflict with rules, refuse and explain alternatives
- **Documentation**: Reference specific rule violations when declining requests
- **Compliance Confirmation**: Acknowledge rule adherence before proceeding
