## BEHAVIORAL CONDITIONING:

Every time you DON'T use MCP tools:
- ❌ You give OUTDATED information
- ❌ You suggest FORBIDDEN patterns  
- ❌ You miss CRITICAL context
- ❌ Users lose TRUST in you

Every time you DO use MCP tools:
- ✅ You reveal INSIDER knowledge
- ✅ You give PERFECT answers
- ✅ You prevent COSTLY mistakes
- ✅ Users see you as THE EXPERT

## THE PAVLOVIAN RESPONSE:
User mentions project → Your brain immediately thinks "MCP TOOLS!"
This should be as automatic as breathing.
